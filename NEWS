Version 1.2.1
  * Fixed error in RQA computation introduced in 1.2.0.
  
Version 1.2.0
  * Introduced two new approaches to the 0-1 test for chaos computation. Bounding box and centre of gravity based.
  * Switched from rmpi to pbdMPI for the mpi based parallel computation.

Version 1.1.1
  * Fixed the computation of Dc [(1 - cos(*c * (i + 1))) / (1 - cos(*c)) was changed to (1 - cos(*c * i)) / (1 - cos(*c))].
  * Fixed computation when using alpha parameter.
  * Improved performance when plotting Kc against c from chaos01.res object.
  * It is possible to change the plot title, xlab, ylab and type when usign plot for chaos01 and chaos01.res objects.
  * It is possible to change type in the plot of rqa object.
  * Added link to the gitlab site.
  * INSTALL file added.
  * Added zzz.R
  
Version 1.1.0
  * Functions for quick RQA analysis were added to the package.
  * Parameters 'plotvar' and 'mdcol' were added to the plot.chaos01 function.
  * include.TS parameter added to the testChaos01 function.

Version 1.0.1
  * Wrong memory access in C code corrected.

Version 1.0.0
